            Goose Egg is a student-created online selling platform founded in April 2022, and we seek to provide a unique marketplace experience to users that simply can't be found elsewhere. This student-sourced and student-populated selling platform offers college students the ability to sell and buy products from other college students, a process which was previously relegated to decentralized Facebook marketplaces and random Craigslist posts. Now, students can sell their old hand-me-downs and old devices, or whatever they may need to get rid of, for some spare cash to spend at the dining halls or on extra-strong coffees during finals week! And students looking to buy these products can rest assured that they will be getting them for the best deals possible, from other college students desparate for some extra spending money. Let the bidding begin!
